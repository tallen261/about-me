            <p>
                I served in the United States Air Force for 6 years as 2W1X1 "Aircraft Armament Systems Technician". 
                I was a 7 level Staff Sergeant when I got out which gave me the opportunity to work with good number of awesome people, who I miss dearly.

                    I studied at the Art Institute of Philadelphia where I earned my Bachelors Degree in Graphic Design. Here I got refine a lot of skills 
                    that I use daily. This place has helped me immensely in moving towards my goal of being a successful designer.
