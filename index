                 I'm a Philadelphia native who loves to draw, design, and create so it's really no suprise that I went to school for Graphic Design. Mashing colors, drawing circles and squares so they look something I do for fun all the time. My hobbies include martial arts instruction and coaching gymnastics in addition to sculpting, painting, airbrushing, and digital drawing.
                 I really like to keep myself busy so mush so, it doesn't feel like there are enough hours in a day. As the climate for design is ever-changing, the demand for a skilled developer is on the rise.
                 Coincidentally, I was presented with a program called "<strong>Vets Who Code</strong>" that teaches military veterans a wide variety of these skills. Using what I hope to learn from this program, I looking to become a more rounded designer and find a place in the world where I can continue to create to my heart's content. I have really started taking a liking to front end developing which also has me constantly thinking of ways to things differently.

         <p>
                I do have some experience with basic html and css, but once again I am looking to get better because I feel like these skills can elevate me to the next level. Here are a couple of examples of some sites that I built as personal projects.
